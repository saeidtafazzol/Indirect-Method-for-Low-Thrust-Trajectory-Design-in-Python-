# Indirect Methods for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design in Python

This repository provides a concise Python tutorial on implementing minimum-fuel, low-thrust trajectory optimization using **indirect methods**. It offers practical, step-by-step guidance without extensive theory derivations.

## Overview

- **Indirect Methods**: Formulate and solve necessary conditions from Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle.
- **Control Smoothing**: Demonstrate handling of thrust switching using simple smoothing techniques.
- **State Transition Matrix (STM)**: Illustrate how to compute sensitivities accurately in gradient-based solvers.

> **Note**: This tutorial is inspired by the paper  
> *"Comparison of Control Regularization Techniques for Minimum-Fuel Low-Thrust Trajectory Design using Indirect Methods"*
