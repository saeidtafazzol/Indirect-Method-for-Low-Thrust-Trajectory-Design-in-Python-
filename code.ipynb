    "In this section, we will talk about the dynamics of the spacecraft assuming that it is only affected by the gravity field of **one** central body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\boldsymbol{r} = [x,y,z]^\\top$ and $\\boldsymbol{v} = [v_x,v_y,v_z]^\\top$ denote the position and velocity vectors of the center of mass of the spacecraft relative to the origin of the heliocentric frame of reference. The dynamics can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\dot{\\boldsymbol{r}} &= \\boldsymbol{v}, \\nonumber \\\\\n",

    "   - The term $\\dfrac{T_{\\max}}{m} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}  \\delta$ represents the acceleration from an external thrust force, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the direction of the thrust and $\\delta$ is the amount of propulsion.\n",
